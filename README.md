## Time Spent
Approximate time spent (in minutes): 40 minutes
## Approach
Brief explanation of the solution.

I've created multilayer architectured project which as standalone solution mapped with asp.net core web api, two class libraries for helpers and models.
Maintain in-memory collection using helper library
I understand in a way that you suggest me to handle validation for insert in controller so commented Data annotation valdation 
Used singleton design pattern
Created test cases for get all task operation.

## Trade-offs
What would you improve with more time?
I can implement interfaces. 
Generic classes for reusable functionalities.
Implement the test case for all end points.
